# Watson on an Assignment

In this tutorial, the students will be asked to explore an existing dataset on their own. 

The assignment is formatted so that the student will have to select the right visual representation to explore the relationship in question.

## Load the Dataset

The in class tutorial has walked you through the steps of obtaining a sample dataset from Watson. For this assignment we will use the **Patterns in Wins and Losses Refinement** dataset.

This dataset is made up of 20 variables. So please do explore the data with "Refine" option before starting the assignment.

The dataset is on Contracts that were negotiated.

## Relations to Explore

1 - Relation between the opportunity amount and client size by revenue, to discover where the money is.

2 - Let us see how we good we are in realizing opportunities across different client sizes. Modify the plot from the first question to reflect the how we fare in capturing opportunities from different types of clients (You should have a plot that has three variables visualized).
